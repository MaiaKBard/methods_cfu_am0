# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?

I most proud of my perserverance through the final_practice I got stuck on one question, I was not totoally confident I did all my work correct so I had my mentor check over it. She gave me feedback and push me in the right direction. Which was very helpful, it guided me to figure out the problems I was having. Then there was the greet_person method I struggled with alot and could not figure it out, my mentor suggested my brain was tired and to sleep on it. I then got up the next morning and figured it fairly fast. Im glad I kept persisting through my struggle!

- What is the power of using methods in our applications?

They allow us to re-use code whenever we'd like. I feel like it also allows you to break down a problem in easy and more readable pieces allowing it be easier to understand.
